			<h2><strong>Pathology Residency Program</strong></h2>
			<P>The pathology residency program at Howard University Hospital provides training for physicians to enter academic medicine, independent practice or community practice. We offer a combined Anatomic and Clinical Pathology four (4) year training program. Residents are trained with a comprehensive curriculum of didactic lectures, slide conferences, interdisciplinary conferences and hands-on learning. There are lots of opportunities for research and scholarly activity within the department and protected time is provided for residents to conduct research.</P>
			<p>Our diverse faculty span both anatomic and clinical pathology. All faculty prioritize resident education and enjoy teaching residents eager to learn. Given the small size of the program, medical staff, faculty and residents work closely together. The Department of Pathology has a high standard of professionalism and strives to provide excellent service to all who interact with the laboratory. </p>
